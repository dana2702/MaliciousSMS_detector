## üöÄ How to Run the App (Emulator or Physical Device)

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Arctic Fox or newer recommended)
- Android Emulator or physical device with SMS capability (API level 26+)

### üß™ Using the Emulator

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Android emulators typically don't support actual SMS receiving. Use these steps to simulate SMS messages or test on a real device.*

1. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
2. Connect a physical Android device or start an **emulator**.
3. Run the app with the green "Run" ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button.
4. On a real device, send a test SMS to yourself containing a link (e.g., `http://example.com`) to trigger detection.

#### To simulate an SMS on emulator (optional):

Use ADB to send an SMS:

```bash
adb emu sms send 1234567890 "Check this link: http://malicious.com"
